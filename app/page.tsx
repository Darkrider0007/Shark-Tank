              <strong>Shark Tank</strong> is a popular American television show
              that features aspiring entrepreneurs and inventors pitching their
              business ideas or products to a panel of wealthy investors, known
              as <strong>Sharks</strong>. The entrepreneurs hope to secure
              investment deals from the sharks in exchange for a percentage of
              their company&apos;s equity. Each contestant has a limited time to
              make their pitch, after which the sharks can ask questions and
              negotiate terms. The show is known for its high-stakes drama,
              candid feedback from the sharks, and the potential for
              life-changing investment offers. <strong>Shark Tank</strong> has
              not only provided a platform for entrepreneurs to showcase their
              innovations but has also entertained and inspired millions of
              viewers around the world.
