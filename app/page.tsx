              &quot;Shark Tank&quot; is a popular American television show that
              features aspiring entrepreneurs and inventors pitching their
              business ideas or products to a panel of wealthy investors, known
              as &quot;sharks&quot;. The entrepreneurs hope to secure investment
              deals from the sharks in exchange for a percentage of their
              company&apos;s equity. Each contestant has a limited time to make
              their pitch, after which the sharks can ask questions and
              negotiate terms. The show is known for its high-stakes drama,
              candid feedback from the sharks, and the potential for
              life-changing investment offers. &quot;Shark Tank&quot; has not
              only provided a platform for entrepreneurs to showcase their
              innovations but has also entertained and inspired millions of
              viewers around the world.
